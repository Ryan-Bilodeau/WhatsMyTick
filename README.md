# WhatsMyTick
This is the Xcode project for the iOS application 'What's My Tick'
What's My Tick is available for purchase on the Apple App Store. 

This project is not to be used for redisribution/resale, but may be used for learning purposes.
Classes and functions found in the project can be used by all.

Code I wrote is found in the TickIdentifierCurrent/Model and TickIdentifierCurrent/Controller files.

The purpose of this app is to aid in tick identification through photo recognition. The
app uses the user's location to determine possible ticks with dieseases and the user's 
image of their tick to rank which tick is most likely.
